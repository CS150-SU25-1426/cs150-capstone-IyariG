# CS150-Capstone

Resources Used:

Source: It was an in class resource I used the assignment that had the surf boards that we did after the first capstone project as inspiration for this I'm sure if you look you'll notice that I tweaked a few things and made the code look more like that one since it was indeed better. This also made the code a lot easier to write since the other code while missing some components was generally similar. 

Source: ChatGPT
For What: I used ChatGPT to help debug my code and understand errors. To better explain, I wrote the code myself, but there were certain things like overloading that I wasn't comfortable with yet. So I asked it for the syntax of overloading, and then I’d write my own code and send it to the AI to ask, “Is this right?” I also used it for debugging, like I’d ask what mistakes I made because, if I'm being honest, I kept writing things and they were always wrong, so I needed some help. But I made sure that my code was still mine. I also used it to better learn how to organize my program using multiple files. I was doing the assignment earlier in the day and it wasn’t letting me run the code, so I thought there was a glitch but it turned out to be my internet. However, I deleted the main file, and then when I remade it, the file didn’t work, so it became a bit of a mess. I did not copy whole code parts.

sources: No other outside sources just a lot of looking back at slides and lectures which took just about as long as the coding itself.
